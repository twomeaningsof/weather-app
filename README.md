# Weather App
I developed the app to practice HTML and CSS with JavaScript. It was also my first contact with an API communication ([OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)). The app allows checking the weather forecast in most cities worldwide three days ahead. There are also implemented functions like API calls based on geolocation and localStorage (if there's any data saved and the Geolocation API is blocked). Design implemented with Mobile First approach.

## Technologies
- Javascript
- Webpack
- BEM + SCSS
- HTML

## Launch
